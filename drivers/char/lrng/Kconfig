	  The Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) is the replacement
	  of the existing /dev/random provided with drivers/char/random.c.
	  It generates entropy from different noise sources and
	  delivers significant entropy during boot.

	prompt "LRNG Entropy Collection Pool Size"
	default LRNG_COLLECTION_SIZE_1024
	help
	  Select the size of the LRNG entropy collection pool
	  storing data without performing a compression operation.
	  The larger the collection size is, the faster the
	  average interrupt handling will be. However, on the
	  other hand the time until the LRNG received full entropy
	  during boot time is longer because entropy is only awarded
	  to events once they are compressed. The collection
	  size represents the number of bytes of the per-CPU
	  memory used to batch up entropy event data.

	  The default value is good for regular operations. Choose
	  larger sizes for servers whose boot time is of less
	  interest. Runtime memory is precious, choose a smaller
	  size.

	  The collection size is unrelated to the entropy rate
	  or the amount of entropy the LRNG can process.

	  of this interface is to verify that the array handling code
	  truly only concatenates data and provides the same entropy
	  rate as the raw unconditioned noise source when assessing
